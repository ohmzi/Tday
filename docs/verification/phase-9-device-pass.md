# Phase 9 device pass — adoption, polish, confetti

Run against the release build that closes Phase 9. See `README.md` in this directory for the row
format and for how the file is closed out.

Phase 9 is the adoption phase, and most of what it changes is what the user sees in the frames
either side of an arrival — a skeleton handing over to content, an overlay taking a screen. Those
are the frames no gate here owns: jsdom computes no layout, so a vitest run can prove a skeleton
spells the row's classes and prove nothing about whether the page held still when the rows landed.
The rows below are the half that has to be looked at.

## Web

- [ ] **PR 40a · web · The feed does not move when the tasks arrive** — a phone, a list with 3+
      tasks on it, on a cold load (hard refresh, or throttle the network to Slow 3G so the
      skeleton is on screen long enough to look at).
      Do:     open the list and watch the point where the grey bars become real rows.
      Watch:  nothing below the header moves sideways or vertically at the handover. The bars sit
              flush against each other, at the same 20 px circle, the same left edge and the same
              row height the real rows land at, so the only change is grey becoming text.
      Fails:  the rows step down or up as they land; a gap between the placeholders closes; the
              text starts further right than the bars did; or the placeholder is a bordered card
              with a fill and the rows that replace it are flat.
      Known:  on Today and All only, the block ABOVE the rows is the page title drawn a second
              time, and the section label that replaces it ("Morning", a date) sits 18 px
              higher — a measured, pre-existing difference between `TodoListLoading`'s heading
              block and the sections' own. Expected here, and not what this row is asking
              about: the check is the ROWS holding still, so read the step above them as
              out of scope rather than as a failure.

- [ ] **PR 40a · web · The handover is a crossfade, not a swap** — a phone, the Anytime feed and a
      shared list, on a cold load with the network throttled to Slow 3G.
      Do:     watch the moment the grey bars become rows, on all eight surfaces the crossfade
              reaches: the Anytime root feed (`NativeFloaterTaskHomeDashboard`), an Anytime list
              (`FloaterListContainer`), the scheduled root feed, the Members sheet of a shared
              list, and then the four `TodoListLoading` screens — Today, All tasks, a scheduled
              list, and both Completed tabs.
      Watch:  the bars fade out over the rows fading in — both halves on one 200 ms clock — and
              the rows are in their final position from the first frame of it. The bars sit ON
              TOP of the arriving rows while they fade, never behind them.
      Fails:  the bars disappear in one frame; the page holds a block of empty space open for the
              length of the fade and then snaps shut; the rows are printed over the top of the
              grey bars instead of under them; anything below the feed steps when the last of the
              placeholder goes.
      Known:  the scheduled root feed had no loading state at all before this row — a placeholder
              appearing there where nothing used to be drawn is the fix, not a regression.
      Known:  the four `TodoListLoading` screens get the fade-OUT half only. What arrives on them
              is not one block — a timeline, three drop targets, an empty state and a pager are
              siblings there, and there is nothing to hang `.tday-content-enter` on that is not a
              wrapper invented for it. The rows appear at full opacity, in their final position,
              under bars that fade off them. A step under the rows as the last of the grey goes
              is still a failure; the rows not fading in is not.

- [ ] **PR 40a · web · Reduce Motion gets the content, not the wait** — the same eight surfaces
      with the OS "Reduce Motion" setting ON.
      Do:     cold-load each one and watch the same moment.
      Watch:  the rows replace the bars immediately, with no fade and no pause in front of them.
              The bars themselves still pulse while they are on screen — a busy indicator that
              has stopped reads as work that has finished.
      Fails:  a beat of nothing between the bars going and the rows arriving (the wait kept after
              the motion was removed); or the placeholder frozen mid-pulse while it waits.

- [ ] **PR 40a · web · The sidebar's account placeholder moves** — desktop, sidebar expanded and
      again collapsed to the rail, on a cold load.
      Do:     watch the two account blocks at the bottom of the sidebar before the user resolves.
      Watch:  both blocks pulse, at the same rhythm as every other skeleton in the app.
      Fails:  they sit perfectly still — which is how a control that has rendered empty looks, not
              how one still loading does.

- [ ] **PR 40a · web · The cold-start shell draws the row the route draws** — a phone, network
      throttled to Slow 3G so the lazy chunk takes a visible moment, on a hard refresh of
      `/app/tday` (and again of `/app`, which holds on the same shell while it decides where to
      send you).
      Do:     watch the three grey task-row bars at the point the shell becomes the real feed.
      Watch:  the bars are flat and flush — no card, no border, no fill, no gap between them —
              and the block of them is the height the three rows that replace it are. Three
              bars of grey, three rows of text, same block.
      Fails:  the placeholder is a bordered tinted card and the rows replacing it are flat; or
              the block of rows closes ~20 px as the spacing between three cards goes.
      Known:  the whole column still steps down at the swap, and this row is not asking about
              that. One shell is the fallback for every lazy route, so it stands a single 56 px
              header in for whichever one resolves; the root feed's own is a 64 px toolbar over
              a 78 px hero block under the safe-area inset — roughly 100 px lower — and its
              gutter is 4 px narrower on a phone (`px-4` against the shell's `px-5`). That is
              pre-existing shell geometry this unit did not touch and could not fix without a
              shell per route. Read the step as expected; judge the bars.
