# Phase 9 device pass — adoption, polish, confetti

Run against the release build that closes Phase 9. See `README.md` in this directory for the row
format and for how the file is closed out.

Phase 9 finishes adopting the vocabulary the earlier phases built, so most of its rows are
migrations whose whole claim is that nothing changed by eye. The exception is the confetti, and it
is the largest gap in the programme: the burst's physics were reconstructed on paper in
`docs/confetti-spec.md`, checked twice by arithmetic and by invariant tests, and have never been
seen moving. Unit tests can prove a piece's path is concave and that its fall settles rather than
accelerating; nothing in this repository can say whether the result reads as paper.

## Web

- [ ] **PR 39a · web · The burst is paper, and the apex is not cut** — any list with exactly one
      task left on it, so completing it empties the list and celebrates. Run it twice: once in a
      tall window, and once with the browser window short enough that the empty state is at its
      `min-h-[42vh]` floor (roughly under 640 px tall) — that second case is the one the canvas
      bleed exists for, and the only one where clipping shows.
      Do:     tick the last task and watch the space above the illustration rather than the row.
      Watch:  the pieces leave a thumb-sized patch at the centre rather than a single point; the
              cloud has all but stopped spreading by ~300 ms and the highest pieces turn over about
              a fifth of the card's WIDTH above the origin at ~415 ms, wholly inside the canvas;
              after the scene lands at ~840 ms everything left is falling at a steady speed rather
              than gathering pace, drifting ±7–15 px sideways at about 1 Hz and turning edge-on on
              a rhythm unrelated to how fast it is spinning; nothing is drawn after 2000 ms.
      Fails:  a piece is sliced along a straight horizontal line near the top of the card while
              still fully opaque (the bleed is not reaching, or the origin was not moved back down
              by it); the whole burst is thrown ~40 px too high (the bleed is in the canvas but not
              in the origin); pieces accelerate out of the bottom instead of settling; a piece goes
              flat exactly when it is side-on to its own travel, which is the flip locked back onto
              the rotation; or the burst ends on an edge you can point at instead of fading out.

## Android

- [ ] **PR 39b · android · The burst is paper, and it still fits the celebrate window** — any list
      with exactly one task left on it, so ticking that task empties the list and celebrates. Run
      it twice: once on a list-detail screen, where the empty scene is an overlay and the burst is
      thrown at once, and once on the floater home feed, where the scene is drawn inline and the
      burst is held 320 ms while the rows below it settle into their new places.
      Do:     tick the last task and watch the space above the illustration rather than the row.
      Watch:  the pieces leave a thumb-sized patch at the centre rather than a single point; the
              cloud has all but stopped spreading by ~300 ms and the highest pieces turn over about
              a fifth of the box's WIDTH above the origin at ~415 ms; the scene rises at 320 ms
              with paper already in the air above it; from ~840 ms everything left is falling at a
              steady speed rather than gathering pace, drifting ±7–15 px sideways at about 1 Hz and
              turning edge-on on a rhythm unrelated to how fast it is spinning; the last piece is
              gone 2000 ms after the throw, well inside `CompletionCelebrationWindowMs`.
      Fails:  pieces accelerate off the bottom of the screen instead of settling, which is the old
              parabola; a piece goes flat exactly when it is side-on to its own travel, which is
              the flip locked back onto the rotation; the burst ends on an edge you can point at
              instead of fading out; the fan clears the sides of the box, which would mean the
              speeds are being read as distances again; on the floater feed paper thrown across a
              Completed tile that is still sliding; or the window closing on paper still in the
              air, which is the 1800 → 2000 ms flight not fitting after all.
