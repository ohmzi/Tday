# Phase 9 device pass — adoption, polish, confetti

Run against the release build that closes Phase 9. See `README.md` in this directory for the row
format and for how the file is closed out.

Phase 9 is the adoption phase, and most of what it changes is what the user sees in the frames
either side of an arrival — a skeleton handing over to content, an overlay taking a screen. Those
are the frames no gate here owns: jsdom computes no layout, so a vitest run can prove a skeleton
spells the row's classes and prove nothing about whether the page held still when the rows landed.
The rows below are the half that has to be looked at.

## Web

- [ ] **PR 40a · web · The feed does not move when the tasks arrive** — a phone, a list with 3+
      tasks on it, on a cold load (hard refresh, or throttle the network to Slow 3G so the
      skeleton is on screen long enough to look at).
      Do:     open the list and watch the point where the grey bars become real rows.
      Watch:  nothing below the header moves sideways or vertically at the handover. The bars sit
              flush against each other, at the same 20 px circle, the same left edge and the same
              row height the real rows land at, so the only change is grey becoming text.
      Fails:  the rows step down or up as they land; a gap between the placeholders closes; the
              text starts further right than the bars did; or the placeholder is a bordered card
              with a fill and the rows that replace it are flat.
      Known:  on Today and All only, the block ABOVE the rows is the page title drawn a second
              time, and the section label that replaces it ("Morning", a date) sits 18 px
              higher — a measured, pre-existing difference between `TodoListLoading`'s heading
              block and the sections' own. Expected here, and not what this row is asking
              about: the check is the ROWS holding still, so read the step above them as
              out of scope rather than as a failure.
